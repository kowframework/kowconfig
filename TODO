Extend the configuration file syntax to include:

	${key}	=> internal substituion, not allowing circular dependency.
		* can be done outside the parser
		* $${} would be treated as ${} text
		* ${key:locale} will look for specific locale, being "default" a keyword to default value
		* ${key} will look for the key in the current key's locale (using Element's syntax)

	dynamic indexed arrays =>
		* such as:
			[Some_Interestin_Section.#] => '#' would be auto-incremented
		* should be done in the parser
