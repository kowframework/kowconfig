=== INSTALLATION ==

This target isn't ready yet but the installation procedure is quite simple.
  1. Copy the contents of src/**/*.ads to the \"include\" folder.
  2. Copy the contents of lib/*.{ali,so,-VERSION_NUMBER} to the \"lib\" folder


With this you can compile fine using the -L and -I options in GNAT.
