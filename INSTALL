- 1 -  BUILDING -
-----------------


When building this library from source you'll get new files in:
	./obj	=> where the object files are built. It's for internal use of the compiler
	./lib	=> where the shared libraries will be linked.
	./bin	=> where the example programs will be linked.

For more information, please read the following sections.

--------------------
- 1.1 Dependencies -
--------------------

To build this library you'll need:
 * awlib sources. They should be in a folder called "../awlib".
 * GNAT >= 4.1.1.
 	- the only supported compiler is GNAT-GCC 4.1.1 but it should work fine with GNAT-GPL
	and GNAT-PRO.

 * XML/Ada - the command xmlada-config got to be in the path.
 	- required only when using XML based configuration files.


---------------------------
- 1.2 Building everything -
---------------------------

This is the easiest and recomended way for new users. Just type:

$ make

In the root of this source distribution. The libraries and .ali files can be found in ./lib and the example programs should be in ./bin.

=== RUNNING ===
To run the example programs that come with this distribution

=== INSTALLATION ==

This target isn't ready yet but the installation procedure is quite simple.
  1. Copy the contents of src/**/*.ads to the \"include\" folder.
  2. Copy the contents of lib/*.{ali,so,-VERSION_NUMBER} to the \"lib\" folder


With this you can compile fine using the -L and -I options in GNAT.
